# goalie-analysis
Data analysis on if NHL goalies are getting worse over time.

# How does this work?

These csv files are taken from Moneypuck. Use concat.py to conbine these files into one .csv file, and then run primary analysis.

# What does this show?

Pretty much, the original hypothesis was that goalies over time have not improved while the skill level of forwards and defenceman have gone up. However, when looking at the data from the primary analysis, goalies have had a significant drop off after the 2021 COVID season. This could be due to the change in the conferences, causing certain conferences to be differently weighted than others. However, at the side time, the only notable drop would be in high danger chances, happening more due to the skill levels of players going much higher.
